    This paper studies the effects of Secure Communities (SC), a wide-ranging immigration enforcement program, on infant health outcomes in 
    the United States. Using administrative birth certificate data together with event study and triple-differences designs, I find that SC 
    increases the incidence of very low birth weight by 21% for infants of foreign-born Hispanic mothers, who were most likely to be affected 
    by immigration enforcement. There is suggestive evidence that the results are consistent with (i) changes in maternal stress induced by 
    deportation fear and (ii) inadequate prenatal nutrition. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that this unintended social cost of 
    immigration enforcement ranges from $872 million to $1.59 billion annually.</div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Prior research provides evidence of implicit and explicit 
    anti-Black prejudice among US physicians. However, we know little about racialized prejudice among physicians and non-physician healthcare workers. 
    Using ordinary least squares models and data from Harvard’s Project Implicit (2007-2019), we assessed the associations between self-reported 
    occupational status (physician, non-physician healthcare worker) and implicit and explicit prejudice toward Black, Arab-Muslim, Asian, and 
    Native Americans, net of demographic characteristics. We found that physicians and non-physician healthcare workers exhibited more implicit 
    and explicit anti-Black and anti-Arab-Muslim prejudice than the general population. After controlling for demographics, these differences 
    became non-significant for physicians but remained for non-physician healthcare workers. Demographic controls largely explained anti-Asian 
    prejudice among both groups and, physicians and non-physician healthcare workers exhibited comparatively lower and similar levels of anti-Native 
    implicit prejudice, respectively. Finally, white non-physician healthcare workers exhibited the highest levels of anti-Black prejudice.</div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This study assessed a broad array of socioeconomic barriers in relation to preferred contraceptive use during 
    a time of exacerbated personal and social financial strain (the COVID-19 pandemic). Using statewide data collected in early 2021 through the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin, we conducted 
    bivariate analyses exploring the relationship between socioeconomic resources and preferred contraceptive use among Wisconsin women. Findings indicated that people lacking socioeconomic resources, 
    including adequate food and housing, may be unable to access their preferred contraceptive method(s). Amidst competing demands on time and resources, the inability to obtain preferred contraceptive method(s) 
    may represent system-wide barriers as well as people's lowered ability to prioritize and access care in light of socioeconomic struggles.</div></p>

    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Prior research has found that a high level 
    of residential racial segregation, or the degree to which racial/ethnic groups are isolated from one another, is associated with worsened 
    infant health outcomes, particularly among non-Hispanic (NH) Black infants. However, because exposure to segregation is non-random, 
    it is unclear whether and to what extent segregation is causally linked to infant health. To overcome this empirical limitation, 
    we leverage exogenous variation in the placement of railroad tracks in the 19th century to predict contemporary segregation, an approach 
    first introduced by Ananat(2011). In alignment with prior literature, we find that residential segregation has statistically significant 
    associations with negative birth outcomes among Black infants. However, analyses that account for the endogeneity of segregation reveal 
    a more complex story: using OLS methods underestimates the negative impacts of segregation on birth weight and fetal growth but overestimates 
    its impacts on prematurity. We fail to detect comparable effects on health outcomes among NH White infants. Further, we identify several key 
    mechanisms by which residential segregation could influence health outcomes among Black infants, including higher levels of anti-Black 
    prejudice, greater transportation barriers, and increased food insecurity. Given that poor birth outcomes have adverse effects on 
    adults’ health and well-being, the findings suggest that in-utero exposure to residential segregation could have important implications 
    for Black-White inequality over the life course.</div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Previous research documented that midwifery service quality 
    improvements lead to improving maternal and infants’ health outcomes. However, little is known about its influence on later-life outcomes 
    including disability. This paper explores the potential effects of early-life exposure to the establishment of midwifery laws across US states 
    on later-life disability outcomes. Midwifery laws were enacted during the late 19th and early 20th century and required midwives to gain formal 
    education and training to obtain a license in order to legally practice. We use decennial census data over the years 1970-2000 and implement 
    a difference-indifference method and show that being born in a reform state is associated with significant reductions in various measures 
    of disability, including work disability, cognitive difficulty, ambulatory difficulty, self-care difficulty, and a proxy for severe mental 
    health. We also find significant increases in education, socioeconomic scores, housing wealth, and income. We further discuss the policy 
    implications of the results.</div></p>

    by analyzing Social Security Administration death records linked with the 1940 census. We exploit variations in lynching incidences to understand their impact on old-age longevity. 
    The results reveal a 3.7 month decrease in longevity for Black males who were exposed to a lynching of a Black victim during gestation. This exposure accounts for approximately 10% 
    of the life expectancy gap between Black and White men in 1980, without negative effects observed among White individuals. Further analysis suggests reductions in socioeconomic

    Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) remain a subject of intense debate during major
    pandemics and endemics, with studies highlighting varied benefits and costs. Yet, little is
    known about the long-term effects of NPIs, particularly among those exposed during early life
    and childhood. This study examines the long-term effects of early-life and childhood exposure
    to NPIs implemented during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic on later-life longevity. Utilizing
    Social Security Administration death records linked to the 1940 census, we investigate the
    differences in longevity of cohorts exposed to the pandemic during early childhood compared to
    those born post-pandemic, in cities with stricter NPIs to those with less stringent measures. The
    findings suggest a reduction in longevity of approximately 2.8 months for those exposed at ages
    7-10. We attribute these effects to school closures and disruptions in children’s socioemotional
    and cognitive development and provide empirical evidence that their later-life reductions in
    education and socioeconomic status as potential pathways.</div></p>

    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Studies have documented Black-White disparities in 
    bankruptcy filings and outcomes, as well as links between bankruptcy and filers’ health. However, little research examines how bankruptcy 
    patterns at the area level may be associated with racial disparities in health outcomes, particularly during early life. Spatial measures 
    of bankruptcy may better capture how structural forces influence bankruptcy patterns and health across groups. In this research note, 
    we use a ProPublica dataset of all consumer bankruptcy cases from 2008-2015, as well as data from the National Vital Statistics System and 
    the American Community Survey, to develop and test a novel measure of racialized spatial inequality in bankruptcy and its relationship with 
    infant health disparities. Specifically, we measure the odds ratio of case dismissal in predominately Black versus White zip codes in the same 
    county. We show that inequality in bankruptcy between Black and White zip codes is associated with Black (but not White) infant health. Our 
    findings persist after controlling for poverty and unemployment, and parental education does not have a protective effect. We also find no 
    evidence to suggest that segregation is the driving factor. This study contributes to literature on race and bankruptcy, as well as structural 
    racism and population health.</div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper examines the effects of the 2016 election on international student enrollments in the United States. Using variation in international student enrollments across U.S. higher education institutions, we find that the Trump election has a negative and significant impact on international enrollments. We provide suggestive evidence that Trump's 2016 win increases the weight on political factors when international students decide where to study. This is evidenced by the decline in international enrollments in Trump counties relative to Clinton counties. Some students, who would have chosen to study at a university in a Trump county may now no longer do so, favoring a university in a Clinton county. Other students who might once have chosen the U.S. for higher education now seem to be reconsidering and looking at other English speaking countries as alternatives.</div></p>

This paper examines the spillover impact of E-Verify on highly-educated citizen women's labor supply (particularly those with young children). Using variation in the implementation of E-Verify across states, I find that E-Verify reduces the labor supply of high-skilled citizen women by 0.3 to 1 percentage point.  These estimates are larger for women with children. Supplemental analyses suggest that lower inflows of undocumented migrants is an important channel. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that E-Verify generated $6.1 billion in annual social costs of lower labor supply of high-skilled citizen women.</div></p>

We characterize strategic substitutes and strategic heterogeneity in such games, and show that the set of such games has infinite measure. Our conditions are easy to apply and yield uncountably many examples of such games. Moreover, in contrast to the case for strategic complements, we show that generically, the set of SPNE in these games is totally unordered (no two equilibria are comparable).</div></p>
