      Abstract
    </button>
    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper studies the effects of Secure Communities (SC), a wide-ranging immigration enforcement program, on infant health outcomes in the United States. Using administrative birth certificate data together with event study and triple-differences designs, I find that SC increased the incidence of very low birthweight by 23% for children of foreign-born Hispanic mothers, who were most likely to be affected by the immigration enforcement. There is suggestive evidence that the results are consistent with changes in maternal stress induced by deportation fear. I find no evidence of differential pre-treatment trends in birth outcomes and no effects among placebo groups.</div></p>

    <p style="margin:0;" }><p > <b>The Spillover: How E-Verify Can Affect High-Skilled Citizen Women</b> <br> <i>under review</i> <br> <button class="accordion">
    Abstract
    </button>
    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Verify Employment Eligibility (E-Verify) is designed to curve the hires of unauthorized immigrants. This paper is the first to examine the spillover impact of E-Verify on highly-educated citizen women’s labor supply (particularly those with young children). Using variation in implementation of E-Verify across states and a state-level panel data set, I find that E-Verify reduces the labor supply of high-skilled citizen women by 0.5 to 1.2 percent. These estimates are larger for women with children. I argue that this reduction is due to an increase in costs of household services where undocumented immigrants are over-represented. The magnitudes of my estimates suggest that E-Verify generated $6.1 billion in social costs of lower labor supply of high-skilled citizen women.</div></p>
  
    <p style="margin:0;" }><p > <b>Two Stage 2 × 2 Games With Strategic Substitutes and Strategic Heterogeneity</b> <br> with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sabarwal/home">Tarun Sabarwal</a>.<i> <br> under review</i> <br> <button class="accordion">
    Abstract
    </button>
    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> We extend Feng and Sabarwal (2018)’s results on two stage 2×2 games with strategic complements to games with strategic substitutes and games with strategic heterogeneity. We characterize strategic substitutes and strategic heterogeneity in such games, and show that the set of such games has infinite measure. Our conditions are easy to apply and yield uncountably many examples of such games. Moreover, in contrast to the case for strategic complements, we show that generically, the set of SPNE in these games is totally unordered (no two equilibria are comparable).</div></p>
      
    <p style="margin:0;" }><p > <b>The Healthy Undocumented Immigrant Effect: Evidence from the US</b> <br> <i>under review</i> <br> <button class="accordion">
    Abstract
    </button>
    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper uses residual approach to identify undocumented populations hidden in micro survey data. I then document what I term the "Healthy Undocumented Immigrant Effect": undocumented immigrants are healthier than legal immigrants. I show evidence that the paradox of the undocumented immigrants’ health advantage can be attributed to the return-migrant effect.</div></p>
